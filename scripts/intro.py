Solar Viz is a comprehensive data tool designed to enhance the understanding and performance of Engie's solar installations. This tool facilitates insightful analyses and predictions related to solar panel performance, aiding in informed decision-making for future solar projects.

Level One: On the homepage, there are 3 graphs based on the user's date inputs. 
1. The first graph shows the solar panel daily generation data for the selected time period.
2. The second graph shows the conversion efficiency of the solar panels for the selected time period.
3. The third graph shows the cost of the energy that the solar panels for the selected time period generated.

Level Two: On the in-depth analysis page, there are 6 analyses that can be performed on the solar panel data.
1. Degradation Analysis
Solar Viz evaluates degradation rates, determining whether degradation is linear or exponential. It predicts future degradation levels for each installation, assisting in proactive maintenance and planning.

2. Payback Analysis
The tool compares the financial success of solar projects by analyzing the offset electricity against representative electricity rates from MidAmerican Energy. It provides insights into the profitability of each installation and predicts when they will turn a profit.

3. Performance Analysis
Solar Viz validates performance predictions for different solar technologies and conditions, assessing generation during peak and off-peak periods. It analyzes the impact of weather conditions on performance, validating initial predictions and suggesting potential operational optimizations.

Solar Viz empowers ENGIE and the University of Iowa to make data-driven decisions, optimize solar installations, and move towards a sustainable and efficient energy future."""
